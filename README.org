* project-mode-line-tag.el

Provides a global minor mode to display information about a buffer's
project (a "project tag") in its mode line.

A buffer's project tag is derived from either its =project.el= project's
root directory (e.g. =bar= for =/code/foo/bar=) or, if present, a
[[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Directory-Local-Variables.html][dir-local variable]] named =project-mode-line-tag= or =project-name=.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =project-mode-line-tag.el=,
put it in your =load-path= and =require= it. Finally, use
=(project-mode-line-tag-mode 1)= or =M-x project-mode-line-tag-mode= to
turn on the provided minor mode.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package project-mode-line-tag
  :ensure
  :config
  (project-mode-line-tag-mode))
#+end_src

* Screenshot

Showing 3 windows; from top to bottom:

- Project tag =project-mode-line-tag= derived from its buffer's related
  =project.el= project's root directory.

- Project tag =foobar= derived from the =project-name= dir-local
  variable that applies to its buffer.

- None of the above, so no project tag.

The face applied to the project tag and the format of how to display it
in the mode line are fully customizable.
