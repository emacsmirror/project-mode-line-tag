⚠️ *Emacs 30 [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/etc/NEWS?id=238292d6571402e93d4f7886baac9853011b36f][adds the project-mode-line facility]], which renders this
package obsolete.*

* project-mode-line-tag.el

Provides a global minor mode to display information about a buffer's
project (a "project tag") in its mode line.

To derive a buffer's project tag, we first look for [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Directory-Local-Variables.html][dir-local
variables]] named =project-mode-line-tag= or =project-name=. If none of
these are set, we call the =project-name= function if it exists (Emacs
29), and fall back to the project’s directory name (e.g. =bar= for
=/code/foo/bar=) otherwise.

In addition, if one of =project-mode-line-tag-template= or
=project-name-template= is present, it is used as the format-string in a
call to =format= to further customize the project tag. The format-string
is expected to have a single =%s= sequence which will be substituted
with the current project tag. This can be useful if you want to have
all projects in a directory share a common prefix, for example.

* Installation

If you use MELPA, an easy way to install this package is via
=package-install=. Alternatively, download =project-mode-line-tag.el=, put
it in your =load-path= and =require= it. Finally, use
=(project-mode-line-tag-mode 1)= or =M-x project-mode-line-tag-mode= to
turn on the provided minor mode.

If you use both MELPA and =use-package=, you can use this, too:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package project-mode-line-tag
  :ensure
  :config
  (project-mode-line-tag-mode 1))
#+end_src

* Screenshot

Showing 3 windows; from top to bottom:

- Project tag =project-mode-line-tag= derived from its buffer's related
  =project.el= project's root directory.

- Project tag =foobar= derived from the =project-name= dir-local variable
  that applies to its buffer.

- None of the above, so no project tag.

The face applied to the project tag and the format of how to display
it in the mode line are fully customizable.

  dir-local variables.

- The [[https://github.com/fritzgrabo/tab-bar-groups][tab-bar-groups]] package integrates with this package and applies
  the current tab bar group's color to the project tag in the mode
  line. You might want to use this in combination with the
  [[https://github.com/fritzgrabo/project-tab-groups][project-tab-groups]] package if you follow a "one tab group per
  project" workflow.
